                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots <br>
                in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <br>
                Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, <br>
                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,<br>
                and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <br>
                Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" <br>
                (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, <br>
                very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, <br>
                "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
